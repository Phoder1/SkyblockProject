In order to make an isometric tilemap work you need to do the following things:
1) Measure the height and width if the tile cap (the top of the tile only)
2) Set the sprite Pixels Per Unit to the cap width
3) Set the tile pivot point to the tile's front edge.
3) Create a new tile pallete with Y = height/width
4) Set the Project settings > Graphics > Transperency Sort Mode to Custom Axis and Axis to (0,1, (Grid Y * -0.5) - 0.01)

Also:
sin( Isometric Angle ) = Tile cap height / Tile cap width
